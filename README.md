# Traktor
An app that displays the top trending movies on Trakt.tv



- An app that uses multiple REST APIs to display information from the top trending movies on trakt.tv

- The information is displayed in a side-scrolling collection view with a carosel affect.

- This app was built over the course of a weekend as part of a code challenge.

- I decided not to use any third-party libraries to try to give a little better insight into my understanding of iOS and Swift Fundamentals.
